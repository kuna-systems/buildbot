    Like PBClientFactory, but if the connection fails or is lost, the factory

    Instead of using f.getRootObject (which gives a Deferred that can only
    be fired once), override the gotRootObject method.

    Instead of using the newcred f.login (which is also one-shot), call
    f.startLogin() with the credentials and client, and override the
    gotPerspective method.

    gotRootObject and gotPerspective will be called each time the object is
    received (once per successful connection attempt). You will probably want
    to use obj.notifyOnDisconnect to find out when the connection is lost.

    If an authorization error occurs, failedToGetPerspective() will be
    invoked.

    TCPClient).
