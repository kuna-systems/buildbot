Customization
=============

For advanced users, Buildbot acts as a framework supporting a customized build
framework.  For the most part, such configurations consist of subclasses set up
for use in a regular Buildbot configuration file.

This chapter describes some of the more common customizations made to Buildbot.
Future versions of Buildbot will ensure compatibility with the customizations
described here, and where that is not possible the changes will be announced in
the ``NEWS`` file.
