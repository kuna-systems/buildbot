				<h2>The Elevator Pitch</h2>
			</header>

            <p>Buildbot is an open-source <b>framework</b> for automating software build, test, and release processes.</p>

            <img src="pictures/header-text-transparent.png" class="middle">

			<footer class="notes">

                I want to begin by talking about how we can model build, test,
                and release processes.  I'll talk more about Buildbot in the
                second part, but for now what you need to know about Buildbot
                is that it is a *framework* for build, test, and release
                automation, rather than an application.

                That means that our users build their own automation within Buildbot, rather than "configuring" Buildbot.

                So in developing Buildbot, we look for general models of the
                processes user automate, and build support for those general
                models.

                For this talk, I'm going to look at concurrency, using it as an
                illustration of this approach.

                CI for simple, small apps is easy to model: it's essentially a
                sequence of shell commands to check out the source, build it,
                run tests, and make packages.  You can do this with a shell
                script in cron or a version control hook.

            <footer class="notes">

                Let's call that a "job".  I'll represent jobs with these very
                Metro-style rectangles in the slides to come.  Time moves from
                left to right, and the length of the rectangle suggests how
                long the job takes to execute.

                I'm using different colors for different "types" of jobs, just
                to help you imagine what the diagrams are showing.  The types
                of the jobs aren't critical to undersatnding the concepts.

                More common: builds on multiple platforms, so multiple hosts.
                Ideally in parallel, but sequential if resources are tight.
                Still, not much to connect these builds together - fire and forget.

                Next iteration: run tests on each platform as soon as its builds are ready

                If you want to run tests in parallel, then you probably want to run them on multiple hosts, not just where they were built,
                meaning more parallelism

                These builds are related: tests are triggered for the platorm that finishes building

			<footer class="notes">

                Release process adds a lot more moving pieces.  I've dropped the labels for simplicity here.

                Once tests have passed, you've got signing, localization,
                uploads, and probably a dozen more tasks in your organization -
                and all of those need to be run with as much parallelism as
                possible.

                We're talking about a lot of jobs here!

			<footer class="notes">

                So: build automation is job scheduling, fundamentally.  Jobs:
                * in response to events (checkins, go-to-build requests, time of day, etc.),
                * with particular parameters (repository, branch, revision, etc.),
                * plus reporting

                Parallelism is represented by multiple jobs running simultaneously

            <p>The connections between jobs define the control flow, in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG).</p>

			<footer class="notes">

                For automation that spans lots of builds, then, the key is how those
                builds interact with one another.

                Going back to the release process, the connections I've drawn here show the flow of control.

                There are two interesting structures here: of the control flow, increasing parallelism, and joins of the control flow, decreasing it.

                In graph-theoretic terms, this is a directed acyclic graph

			<footer class="notes">

                Branch: one job submits others to the job scheduler.
                Ex: a Linux build job submits several Linux test jobs when its build completes successfully.

            <p>A job begins after prerequisite jobs are complete</p>

			<footer class="notes">

                Joining means starting a new job when a set of other jobs are complete.
                But which jobs?
                * All tests with the same revision?
                * All localization jobs that branched from the same job?
                * at least 50% successful smoke tests, before acceptance tests run?
                * may have to wait a while between first and last joined job
                Users can get a lot of expressive power out of this, if it's general

                Pattern-matching across a stream of job-finished events - event stream querying.

                Reporting is tricky.
                1. When do we report?
                  As soon as there's a problem (potentially many alerts)
                  or after the entire DAG is finished? (potentially delayed alerts)
                2. How do we summarize?
                  Lots of logfiles, lots of exit statuses from commands
                  In a release, probably lots of expected failures

                So let's look at how this is currently implemented in Buildbot.

                A word of warning: Buildbot is 10 years old, and when it began it was just used for building, so what we have been calling a "job", Buildbot calls a "build".
                In fact, Buildbot uses the word "Build" in far too many places.

                First, a quick overview of how Buildbot works.

                Master / slave architecture
                Logic is on the master
                Slaves run the actual commands
                Master polls version control, handles job scheduling, reports the results

				<h2>Buildbot: Master Organization</h2>
			</header>

            <img src="pictures/master.svg" class="middle">

			<footer class="notes">

                Master generates a stream of changes from version control.
                Schedulers are responsible for submitting jobs
                  Based on Changes, time-of-day, or other events
                  Jobs are "build requests" until they are actually performed

                  ** Set of jobs submitted as a set are a "buildset" **

                Builders specify the steps for a job, and are also used to filter reporting.
                  Each has its own queue of requests, and a set of buildslaves, and allocates
                  The result is a "build".

                More complex model is Triggerable
                Schedulers still submit a buildset full of build requests, but now in response to a trigger from a step in another build.

                In this case, this step might be near the end of a compile job,
                and passes info on the built artifacts to the triggered builds (using properties)

                Trigger can be fire-and-forget, where the build with the trigger step goes on to its next step immediately
                Can also automatically join the branched builds, with waitForFinish
